# FaceAPI-WPF-Samples-Photo-Manager
Extending the Azure FaceAPI demo solution, to include a photo manager.

Using Congitive Services Face Recognition API, to identify and catalogue the people in my large photo collections.

This project is an extention to the excellent introduction to Mcrosoft Azure's Congitive Services Face Recognition API.

This exrfa scenario demonstrates and provides a working product, for managing your photo stores.

Once the AI is trained with your sample images, you can chug through and tag all your photos much faster than any other tool!

Ultimately, once the AI is smart enough, it can process 28,000 a day, on the FREE BAND, which should be more than sufficient for most of us!

I am deeply in love with this feature, and will be working to extend and improve this repo much further.

I have also already started migrating this WPF application over to a Windows Store App, which I will publish for free in the coming weeks.

I am also planning to ask the Product Team to accept this, to be pulled on the repo above. 

I publish the rough draft early, as I was asked for a quick demonstation. 
I publish this as a Minimal Viable Product!

Buffing and detailed documentation will be rolling out over the coming days.

I plan to make this sample as easy as possible for anyone to pick up and get started with.
